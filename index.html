                    <p>
                      Clemente Spampinato was born in Calabria, Italy
                      in 1912. At a young age while being schooled in
                      the classical arts in Rome, he developed a keen
                      love for both art and athletics. He became a
                      devoted follower of top Italian sporting events.
                      He befriended many of Italy's top-flight
                      athletes including the great Olympic Champions.
                      In the 1930's & 1940's he was commissioned to
                      sculpt many Bronze Trophies & Medallions for the
                      Olympics and other Italian sporting events.
                    </p>
                    <!-- <p>
                      Although Spampinato became a successful artist in
                      Italy, he longed for much more. In 1947 he became
                      an American citizen and moved to SoHo, NY, which
                      became his new home. His newfound passion was the
                      "American West". He was inspired by the legends of
                      American Cowboys & Indians. He specialized in
                      sport and western sculptures. He lived a full life
                      of art and sport and then quietly passed away in
                      New York in December 1993.

                      His sculpture captures the "essence of movement"
                      beautifully when the human body is at the
                      "greatest point of height, speed and dynamics".
                      His belief that art, in particular sculpture,
                      has its objective solidly rooted in tradition.
                      He has been admired for his ability to bring to
                      life the complex movements of sport and western
                      life while at the same time maintaining a strong
                      sense of realism. Each bronze sculpture is cast
                      in special limited editions and is handcrafted
                      in the "lost wax" process.

                    <!-- <p>
                    In more recent times, Spampinato has been involved
                    in several one-man exhibitions, including in 1968 a
                    "Sport and Western" exhibit at the National Art
                    Museum of Sport at the Madison Square Garden in New
                    York. His show, a "Salute to the Olympics", held at
                    the Abercrombie & Fitch Gallery in New York, was a
                    gala benefit to raise funds for the 1972 Olympic
                    Games.

                    Among his many achievements, Spampinato was
                    commissioned by the Class Committee of the United
                    States Naval Academy to create a bronze statue of
                    the "Navy Goat" mascot. It was installed in 1957 at
                    Annapolis, MD. In 1974, he was selected to create
                    the greater-than-life size bronze of the famous
                    golfer, Bobby Jones, now on permanent display in the
                    World Golf Hall of Fame in Pinehurst, NC. A few
                    years later in 1980, he was chosen to exhibit his
                    works during the XIII Winter Olympic Games at Lake
                    Placid, NY. The United States Information Agency
                    chose Mr. Spampinato to represent the United States
                    in the European and Russian exhibitions entitled
                    "Reflections: Images of America". He was a Fellow of
                    many distinguished organizations, including the
                    National Sculpture Society, the International
                    American Institute and the Gold Medal Artists
                    Committee of International Fine Arts Council.

              Sport and Western Collection sculptures range in prices
              starting from $3,000 to $15,000 and up for each Sport
              bronze, and $5,800 to $21,000 and up for each Western
              bronze, depending on size and subject. Many bronze
              sculptures are available for immediate delivery while
              others must be ordered. All bronzes can be custom
              ordered in various dimensions and a variety of patinas.
            </p>
            <p>
              Each sculpture is created using the “Lost Wax” process
              whereby each piece is created as a clay armature then a
              plaster mold is made that eventually creates a wax mold
              and finally the sculpture is cast into bronze. Therefore
              custom order pieces may take three to five months
              depending on size and finish. Each bronze is
              individually created, whereby patina and sizes are
              approximate and may vary slightly.
            </p>
            <p>
              Virtually any bronze in the collection can be enlarged
